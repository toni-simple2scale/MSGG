    -   **Next debug checklist**:
        1.  Take a screenshot or GIF of the new transition effect.
        2.  Use  to show it to the user and confirm if the smooth fade is acceptable.

    -   **Status**: USER VERIFICATION PENDING
    -   **Is recurring issue?**: Y (The gallery UX has been iterated on multiple times).
    -   **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?**: Frontend.

-   **Issue 2: Mobile text layout bug in the Sobre Nós section**
    -   **Attempted fixes**: None. The agent acknowledged the user's report ( & associated image) but got distracted by other requests and never addressed it.
    -   **Next debug checklist**:
        1.  Inspect the Sobre Nós section on a mobile viewport (375px).
        2.  Identify the text block that is wrapping incorrectly (as shown in the user's uploaded image ).

    -   **Next debug checklist**:
        1.  The user has already provided edited images. The latest one is .
        2.  Ask the user if they can provide a compressed version of this image (e.g., using TinyPNG).
        3.  If the user cannot, the agent should propose using an image optimization tool if available in the environment, or clearly state this is a limitation that the user must handle post-delivery.
    -   **Why fix this issue and what will be achieved with the fix?**: To drastically improve the website's initial load time (Largest Contentful Paint), which is critical for user experience and SEO.
    -   **Status**: NOT STARTED
    -   **Is recurring issue?**: Y
    -   **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?**: Frontend.

**Code Architecture**


**Key Technical Concepts**
-   **Frontend**: React.js, Tailwind CSS
-   **UI Components**: Shadcn UI
-   **Animations**: Framer Motion
-   **Carousels**: Embla Carousel
-   **Icons**: Lucide React

-   **State Management**: React Hooks (, , )

**key DB schema**
-   N/A (No database)

**changes in tech stack**
-   None

**All files**
-   **/app/frontend/src/pages/Home.js**: The main component for the landing page. It was heavily modified to handle hero section changes, gallery implementation and fixes, contact form logic, and various layout adjustments.
-   **/app/frontend/src/components/Footer.js**: Modified to change text content and reposition the Siga-nos (Follow us) section.
-   **/app/frontend/src/pages/PoliticaPrivacidade.js, PoliticaCookies.js, InformacoesLegais.js**: Edited to remove incorrect analytics provider mentions and redundant navigation buttons.
-   **/app/frontend/src/App.css**: Updated to add keyframes for a shimmer/skeleton loading effect.
-   **/app/frontend/public/sitemap.xml**: New file created to improve SEO.
-   **/app/OTIMIZACAO_IMAGENS.md, /app/DEPLOY_VERCEL.md, /app/WEB3FORMS_PORTUGUES.md**: New documentation files created to provide instructions to the user.

**Areas that need refactoring**
-   The image lightbox functionality in  is duplicated for two different use cases (the store gallery and the About Us image). This could be extracted into a single, reusable  component to reduce code repetition and simplify .

**key api endpoints**
-   N/A (The only external communication is a POST request to  for the contact form).

**Critical Info for New Agent**
-   The user is highly detail-oriented and prefers an iterative workflow with visual confirmation (screenshots) for every change. Always provide screenshots for both desktop and mobile views after UI modifications.
-   The contact form uses Web3Forms. It will show a CORS error when tested on , which is expected. The form is confirmed to work only when deployed to a live domain like Vercel.
-   The user is sensitive to how credits are used. Avoid mistakes and be precise with fixes. If an attempt fails, apologize, explain the new approach, and correct it promptly.
